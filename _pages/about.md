I am a first year PhD Student at INRIA Paris/Sorbonne Universit√© with Claire Monteleoni. I will be studying climate model emulation using machine learning. I am particularly excited about investigating impacts of land-use change and seeing how improvements can be made to long-range emulations (ClimateBench!).
