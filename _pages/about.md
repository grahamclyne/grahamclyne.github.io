I’m a third-year PhD candidate at INRIA-Paris and Sorbonne Université, where I work with Claire Monteleoni and Anastase Charantonis. My research focuses on using generative learning to improve climate models through emulation. So far, I’ve developed an emulator for the IPSL-6CMA-LR model ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.15942)) and I’m now exploring ways to interpolate between climates produced under different SSPs. More broadly, I’m motivated by reducing uncertainty in future climate projections, and I mainly draw on flow-based generative methods and computer vision techniques to do so.
